# ByPer_Analysis

# Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to perform the descriptive search using Pyber ride sharing data. With this project we learnt about the different city rides, drivers and type of cities have adverse or minimal output. The understanding of fare metrics and ride counts by the type of cities in which Pyber operates. the visualization of data helps us to improve the ride services and determine the affordability for all type of neighbours.

# Results:

The results of the cyber summary stated below:

- with three different types of cities the average fare per ride and driver is the highest in rural as compare to suburban and urban which is $34.62 and $55.48. However the number of driver counts in rural areas is only 78 where as in suburban it is 490 and in urban it is 2405.

- the total fares even though the average fare per ride and driver is lowest in urban cities but the total fares is highest as compare to rural and suburban. The fate is $39854.28 in urban and $4327.93 in rural which is the lowest.

- this can be said that the relationship between fare revenue is depends on the city type when there is more number of drivers count than rides.

# Summary:

To summarize this analysis we can recommend to Pyber:
-the average fare per ride is highest I rural than suburban and urban cities which indicates that long trips are involved more and keeping all the drivers mostly busy. This results the loss of other demand for rides from neighbours.

-suburban comes in second most highest fare per ride and driver with Toal fares which tells the CEO not to change anything in here but rather to follow strategy for rural and urban areas which can balance the output.

- increase the amount of drivers in rural areas may minimize the ride fare per ride and also can increase the number of rides as per demand.
